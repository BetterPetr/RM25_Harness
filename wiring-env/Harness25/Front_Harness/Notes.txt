Front Harness Notes:

Need to fix the APPS sensor connection points to the ECU (currently shifted by 1)

Need to adjust the wiring for the E-Throttle (moving back to Noah's design)

See more notes about the CAN Bus termination resistors in the PDM15 and ECU M150 manuals.
(Image in this Folder as reference for how resistors are attached)
