Back Harness Notes:

Crankcase pressure - This sensor was never put on RM24, so it was not immediately apparent as to where
it should go. It goes in the top center hole of the head of the engine (will need an adapter to fit).
This uses (as of writing this) a MoTeC pressure sensor connector.

Shiftdrum Sensor - Just above the gearbox (right next to the starter motor). Uses a Honda specific
connector. Uses RPM of the engine and wheel speed to determine gear being used (may want to check
this, unsure exactly what it's looking at).
